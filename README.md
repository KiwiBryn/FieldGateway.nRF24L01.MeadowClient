# FieldGateway.nRF24L01.MeadowClient
Sample Wilderness Labs Meadow client for my nRF24L01 field gateway projects

With some gateways (e.g. AdaFruit.IO) the device will be configured "automagically" on first update and it's just a matter of 
changing the feed name to something human readable. For other gateways (e.g. Microsoft IoT Central) the device will need to 
be manually provisioned.
